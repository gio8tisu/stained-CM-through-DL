# Data-driven Confocal Microscopy to Hematoxylin and Eosin Transformation

This the code repo for my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/gio8tisu/thesis/main.pdf).

Core files for the denoising and image-to-image-translation are inside the [despeckling](./despeckling)
 and [cyclegan](./cyclegan) directories, respectively.
Training and other scripts are in the root directory.
